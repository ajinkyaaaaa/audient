# Design Reference

Place Figma exports here as PNG images for Claude to reference during development.

## Guidelines
- Export at **2x resolution** for clarity
- **One screen per image** — don't combine multiple screens
- Name files descriptively: `auth-screen-login.png`, `home-screen.png`
- For stateful screens, export each state: `auth-screen-error.png`, `auth-screen-loading.png`
